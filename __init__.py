"""General logging facility

This module attempts to provide a simple programming API for logging
with a pluggable API for defining where log messages should go.

Programmers call the LOG function to log information.

The LOG function, in turn, calls the log_write method to actually write
logging information somewhere.  This module provides a very simple
log_write implementation.  It is intended that applications main
programs will replace this method with a method more suited to their needs.

The module provides a register_subsystem method that does nothing, but
provides a hook that logging management systems could use to collect information about subsystems being used.

The module defines several standard severities:

  TRACE=-300   -- Trace messages

  DEBUG=-200   -- Debugging messages

  BLATHER=-100 -- Somebody shut this app up.

  INFO=0       -- For things like startup and shutdown.

  PROBLEM=100  -- This isn't causing any immediate problems, but deserves
                  attention.

  WARNING=100  -- A wishy-washy alias for PROBLEM.

  ERROR=200    -- This is going to have adverse effects.

  PANIC=300    -- We're dead!

Also, looging facilities will normally ignore negative severities.

To plug in a log handler, simply replace the log_write function
with a callable object that takes 5 arguments:


      subsystem -- The subsystem generating the message (e.g. ZODB)

      severity -- The "severity" of the event.  This may be an integer or
                  a floating point number.  Logging back ends may
                  consider the int() of this valua to be significant.
                  For example, a backend may consider any severity
                  whos integer value is WARNING to be a warning.

      summary -- A short summary of the event

      detail -- A detailed description

      error -- A three-element tuple consisting of an error type, value, and
               traceback.  If provided, then a summary of the error
               is added to the detail.

The callable object can provide a reinitialize method that may be
called with no arguments to reopen the log files (if any) as part of a
log-rotation facility. 

There is a default stupid logging facility that:

  - swallows logging information by default,

  - outputs to sys.stderr if the environment variable
    STUPID_LOG_FILE is set to an empty string, and

  - outputs to file if the environment variable
    STUPID_LOG_FILE is set to a file name.

  - Ignores errors that have a severity < 0 by default. This
    can be overridden with the environment variable STUPID_LOG_SEVERITY
